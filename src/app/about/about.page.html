      Established in 1979, The Food Pantries for the Capital District is a network of food pantries and hunger relief
      partners in New York's Capital Region. Working together to feed the hungry we support our pantries by funding,
      purchasing, collecting, and delivering food. We provide a forum for networking, coordinating services, sharing
      best practices and innovations, and raising awareness. We are a voice for the local hungry. Our vision is a
      hunger-free Capital Region.
