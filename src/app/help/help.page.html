          1) Loading the app will take you to the Map screen and attempt to determine your location and load up all
          pantry data. If you've already loaded data today it will take existing data, otherwise it will load fresh
          data. If no data is available then it will give you an error message.
          <br>
          2) Find a marker near you, or navigate to the Directory page from the left side menu. In either case clicking
          will open up a sub menu with all the ways to interact with the pantry that are available; calling, website, or
          getting direction. In addition you can favorite or unfavorite a pantry.
          <br>
          3) Filtering the data is easy. Your options are filter by category, where you decide which of the 22
          categories you care most about. Filter by miles from you, which filters things based on 'as the crow flies'
          distance from you to them. Finally you can filter by keyword, which will filter by any text at all the pantry
          has in its entry.
          <br>
          4) Navigating to the settings page will allow you to set the default distance and categories you care about
          across the rest of the app
          <br>
          5) The Favorites page will list any saved organizations that you've Favorited elsewhere for quick access.
